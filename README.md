"The Employee Management System" is an efficient and intuitive web application developed using technologies such as **Spring MVC, Hibernate, and JSP (JavaServer Pages)**.

It serves as a powerful tool for managing employee data within a company, enabling the addition of new employee records and the removal of existing ones.

Key features of the application include:

Viewing Employee List: The application interface displays a user-friendly table containing all available data about employees. Each entry in the table includes information about the employee's first name, last name, department, and salary.

Adding Employees: Users have the ability to add new employees through a convenient form that provides fields for entering the employee's first name, last name, department, and salary. After filling out the form, clicking the "OK" button allows the data to be saved to the database.

Removing Employees: If you need to delete an employee's data from the system, you can select the corresponding entry in the employee table and click the "Delete" button. This action will remove the employee's information from the database.

Visual Enhancement: The application is designed with a focus on user-friendliness and a positive user experience. The interface is styled using CSS to provide a modern and aesthetically pleasing look. The buttons feature rounded corners and pleasant colors, enhancing the overall brightness and clarity of interaction with the application.
